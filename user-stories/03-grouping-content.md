# Grouping by Content

## US-3.1 Auto-group by content
**As a** user  
**I want** photos grouped automatically by visual/content similarity  
**So that** I can review “same place”, “same event”, or similar scenes together.

- Backend/ML groups images (e.g. embeddings, scene labels).
- UI shows groups as albums or clusters with a representative thumbnail.

## US-3.2 Name or label content groups
**As a** user  
**I want** to name or add a label to a content-based group  
**So that** I can find it later (e.g. “Beach 2024”, “Conference”).

- PhotoEditor group name/description.
- Optional: merge/split groups.

## US-3.3 Browse content groups
**As a** user  
**I want** to browse and open a content group  
**So that** I can see all photos in that group and pick or edit.

- Click group → gallery filtered to that group.
- Optional: “ungroup” or move single photo out.
