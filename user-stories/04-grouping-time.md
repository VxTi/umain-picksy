# Grouping by Time (Session / Time Window)

## US-4.1 Group by time window
**As a** user  
**I want** photos grouped by time (e.g. session or 5‑minute debounce window)  
**So that** bursts and same-session shots are together without manual grouping.

- Configurable window (e.g. 5 min debounce: new group if gap > 5 min).
- “Session” = from app/camera start to end, or by time gap.

## US-4.2 View and name time groups
**As a** user  
**I want** to see time-based groups (e.g. “Session 1”, “14:00–14:05”) and optionally name them  
**So that** I can treat them like mini-events and find them later.

- List/calendar of time groups.
- Rename group (e.g. “Birthday cake”).

## US-4.3 Adjust time window
**As a** user  
**I want** to change the time-window rule (e.g. 5 min vs 30 min)  
**So that** grouping matches how I think about “one event”.

- Settings: debounce window or session definition.
- Re-run grouping or apply to new imports only.
