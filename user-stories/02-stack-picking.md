# Stack Picking (Pick Top from Stack)

## US-2.1 Create a stack
**As a** user  
**I want** to group at least two photos into a “stack”  
**So that** I can later pick the best one as the representative.

- Select ≥2 photos and “Create stack” (or auto-detect similar/burst).
- Stack has a visual indicator (e.g. stacked icon, count badge).

## US-2.2 Pick top from stack
**As a** user  
**I want** to choose one photo in a stack as the “top” / representative  
**So that** that photo is shown in the gallery and the rest are de‑emphasized or hidden by default.

- In stack view: select “Set as top” for one photo.
- Gallery shows top photo; others accessible via “expand stack”.

## US-2.3 Reorder or change top
**As a** user  
**I want** to change which photo is the top of a stack  
**So that** I can correct my choice without recreating the stack.

- One action: “Set as top” on any photo in the stack.
